# QuantizedResnet50

The objective is to train a ResNet50 model and quantize the model into int8 version.

__How to get the trained model__
Run train.py __python train.py__
(Arguments to be added soon)

__How to quantize the model__
Run benchmark.py __python benchmark.py__
This will convert the trained fp32 model into int8 model. Also it prints out the basic accuracy and sizes of the models.
(Arguments to be added soon)
